# mpfr
## Cross
### Cross Configure
no need for --build and --host (set to gnu) as the configure script is smart
enough to detect them

LTO couldn't be enabled on the shared version of mpfr, as it would result
in the following error when running configure:
error: --enable-lto can only work in static mode (--disable-shared)

mini-gmp has less memory footprint and is smaller than GMP but is slower (up
to 10 times slower in some cases). You should never install mini-gmp as
applications can either include `mini-gmp.c` or compile it and use the
declarations in `mini-gmp.h`

--with-gnu-ld since we're using GNU binutils ld bfd (and not gold as it 
doesn't build with musl without PIE)

Don't use `--with-gmp` flag, even if it correctly detects libgmp in the first
stage of mpfr as `/home/glaucus/cross/lib/libgmp.so.10` as this isn't 100%
correct, as it should show `/cross/lib/libgmp.so.10` and it will cause build
failures in the second stage of building mpfr such as detecting that the C
compiler doesn't work, or not finding the correct libgmp.so to link to.
Instead stick with what's recommended, and that's using LDFLAGs rpath.

Passing `--with-sysroot` alone (without `--with-gmp`) will cause mpfr to look
for libgmp.so in $CRSS/$TUPL instead of $CRSS.

Still needs to get rid of the long path in `ldd libmpfr.so`

## System
### System Configure
MPFR built with Ofast only (without `-fno-finite-math-only` causes problems with
packages using GCC such as lbzip2 not being able to use the libstdcxx correctly
due to missing symbols.

From the system build log:
```C
configure: WARNING: The test NAN != NAN is false. The probable reason is that
configure: WARNING: your compiler optimizes floating-point expressions in an
configure: WARNING: unsafe way because some option, such as -ffast-math or
configure: WARNING: -fast (depending on the compiler), has been used.  You
configure: WARNING: should NOT use such an option, otherwise MPFR functions
configure: WARNING: such as mpfr_get_d and mpfr_set_d may return incorrect
configure: WARNING: results on special FP numbers (e.g. NaN or signed zeros).
configure: WARNING: If you did not use such an option, please send us a bug
configure: WARNING: report so that we can try to find a workaround for your
configure: WARNING: platform and/or document the behavior.
```

LTO couldn't be enabled on the shared version of mpfr, as it would result
in the following error when running configure:
error: --enable-lto can only work in static mode (--disable-shared)

Also, `--enable-decimal-float` can't be used on system mpfr...:
```C
configure: error: internal or link error.
Please build MPFR without --enable-decimal-float.
```
