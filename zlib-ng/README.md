# zlib-ng
## Chroot
### Configure
Since the configure script attempts to run `bash` which requires specifying `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TOOL/lib` to run, we're changing the shell of the configure script to `dash` which makes the script work exactly the same.

This is only done inside the chroot environment and not inside system.

The patch is applied in configure and not in prepare because it has nothing to do with the sources but with the configuration system of the ceras.
### Install
Don't install as `install-shared` in native because we need the header files it
provides for both binutils and gcc to use `zlib-ng` as a fallback mechanism for
LTO when `zstd` isn't available.
## System
### Build
Doesn't build with `-fno-common`:
```C
/toolchain/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-musl/9.2.0/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-musl/bin/ld: deflate_quick.o (symbol from plugin): in function `deflate_quick':
(.text+0x0): multiple definition of `static_ltree'; trees.o (symbol from plugin):(.text+0x0): first defined here
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [Makefile:233: example] Error 1
```
### Install
Don't install as `install-shared` in system because we need the header files it
provides for certain cerata (e.g. `ccache` when used with
`--without-bundled-zlib`).
