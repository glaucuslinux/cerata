-You are seeing this message because a user-specific initialization script is
-not found at ~/.yashrc. The current session has been loaded with common
-settings that should be useful for many users. To suppress this message, copy
-a sample initialization script from ${yashdatadir}/initialization/sample
-to ~/.yashrc and make any customization in it if you want. For bare default
-settings, put an empty file at ~/.yashrc. Without ~/.yashrc, you will see this
-message again next time you start yash.
