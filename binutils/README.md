# binutils
config.guess and config.sub are stored along binutils because it's the first
GNU package we build, plus it usually has the latest versions of the two so it
makes sense to store them here.

To get the latest upstream versions of these two files:

`wget -O config.guess 'https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD'`

`wget -O config.sub 'https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.sub;hb=HEAD'`

## Cross
### Cross Configure
no need for --build and --host (set to gnu) as the configure script is smart
enough to detect them

GNU's gold linker doesn't like musl, as it refuses to build without
enabling PIE support, and bloats things up after enabling PIE support
and yet manages to still fail:

<https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/49071>

`--disable-gold` is the default option, only ld is built

`--enable-lto` is enabled by default

`--enable-plugins` is on by default as it's needed for largefile? (it's also
needed when building gold)

`--enable-64-bit-bfd` is enabled by default for 64 bit targets, as it's only
intended for enabling 64-bit support on 32-bit (and smaller) hosts

`--enable-64-bit-archive` is enabled by default for 64 bit targets as it's
only intended for enabling 64-bit support on 32-bit (and smaller) hosts

`--enable-deterministic-archives` because:

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49211308/deterministic-mode-in-ranlib-in-gnu-utilities>

`--disable-werror` is on by default so no need to add it

Added --with-lib-path from LFS for better separation from the host

`--enable-threads=yes` is only for gold and since gold is disabled by default
and is not being used in the final system this option is not being used.

`--with-arch` is only available for gas and for architectures other than x86
like v2, v2j, v3, v3f...

### Install
The symlink from lib64 to lib has already been created in prepare, also
install-strip doesn't work with readline.

## Native
### Native Configure
No need to apply config.guess and config.sub here because they were applied
already in cross and weren't changed.

Added --with-lib-path from LFS for better separation from the host

GNU's gold linker doesn't like musl, as it refuses to build without
enabling PIE support, and bloats things up after enabling PIE support
and yet manages to still fail:

Be careful as CPPFLAGS isn't honored, but CFLAGS is!

## System
### System Configure
binutils enables plugins support by default
